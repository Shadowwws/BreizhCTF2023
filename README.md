# My challenges for the Breizh CTF 2023 with their writeup.

The whole (I think) infrastructure will be released on the official repository of the competition so you will only find the source code here for the challenge part.

You can still run the remote challenges (Ca tourne and Quelle Courbe) yourself with 
```bash
socat TCP-LISTEN:1337,fork,reuseaddr EXEC:'python main.py'
```
You change the "python main.py" according to the name and langage of the challenge, then you connect on ip "0.0.0.0" and port 1337 like every netcat challenge.

I hope you liked them or will like them when you try them.
